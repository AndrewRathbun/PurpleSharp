Defending enterprise networks against attackers continues to present a difficult challenge for blue teams. Prevention has fallen short; improving detection & response capabilities has proven to be a step in the right direction. However, without the telemetry produced by adversary behavior, building new and testing existing detection capabilities will be constrained. 

PurpleSharp is a C# adversary simulation tool that executes adversary techniques with the purpose of generating attack telemetry in monitored Windows environments. Detection engineering teams can leverage this telemetry to identify gaps in visibility as well as test the resilience, improve existing and build new detection analytics.

Visit the Wiki to view the [Demos](https://github.com/mvelazc0/PurpleSharp/wiki/Demos). PurpleSharp was first presented at [Derbycon IX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TVp4g4hkpg). 

An updated version of PurpleSharp will be released on August 6th as part of BlackHat Arsenal 2020.
