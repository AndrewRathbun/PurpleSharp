Defending enterprise networks against attackers continues to present a difficult challenge for blue teams. Prevention has fallen short; improving detection & response capabilities has proven to be a step in the right direction. However, without the telemetry produced by adversary behavior, building new and testing existing detection capabilities will be constrained. 

PurpleSharp is an open source adversary simulation tool written in C# that executes adversary techniques within Windows Active Directory environments. The resulting telemetry can be leveraged to measure and improve the efficacy of a detection engineering program. PurpleSharp leverages the MITRE ATT&CK Framework and executes different techniques across the attack life cycle: execution, persistence, privilege escalation, credential access, lateral movement, etc. It currently supports 37 unique ATT&CK techniques.

Visit the Wiki to view the [Demos](https://github.com/mvelazc0/PurpleSharp/wiki/Demos). PurpleSharp was first presented at [Derbycon IX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TVp4g4hkpg). 

An updated version of PurpleSharp will be released on August 6th as part of BlackHat Arsenal 2020.
